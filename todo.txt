separate user auth for hooks and static-served files

argument validation: typeof x == string

hook to add user to apiUsers

get rid of server::hooks structure?
    - use routing tables directly

bug: hook exceptions return too much to client
    throw new Error('Baloney!');

better function sandbox (like node-red)
    security
    require('fs') problem
    run like node-red functions
        controlled context
    eventually you'll have fs privs and database privs anyway

inject "request" and whitelist requirable modules

argv.load: command line flag to load a hooks file at startup (from file: / http:)
    - requires factoring out saveHook()

bug:
    click hook_1 and change the text
    click hook_2
    the change to hook_1 is lost without warning

clear editor on delete? (of last hook)

method to lock/disable admin api until next restart
    /hx/lock {"confirm": true, username:, password:}

bug(?): new hook (no hookId) on existing path/method pair
    new hook
    set path to an existing hook
    save
    should message or replace existing hook
    instead, creates unhittable route
    error message for this case?

passport integration for authentication

per-request log interrogation

move the protected api to /hx/hooks?
    /hookex/hooks
    /hookex/logs
    /hookex/lock
    /hookex/users
    where the editor?  /hookex/editor? /editor?

bcrypt the passwords

docker container recipe

consider integrating for /public file manager:
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudcmd
