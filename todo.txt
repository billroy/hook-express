logging

why isn't console log colorized?

API and internals

bug: argv.api_base != '/hx' borks client
    template this through to editor/index.html
    also public/index.hsml

hookBoss.save should handle array of hooks

method to lock/disable admin api until next restart
    POST /hx/lock {"confirm": "lock"}

enable easy embedding in other express apps (like cloudcmd)

optional additional user auth table for hooks and static-served files from /public
    /hx/users
    hook to add/delete/list user to apiUsers

get rid of server::hooks structure?
    - use routing tables directly
    how to identify hooks for replacement?
        name is working pretty well...

Security

bug: hook exceptions return too much to client
    throw new Error('Baloney!');

better function sandbox (like node-red)
    security
    require('fs') problem
    run like node-red functions
        controlled context
    eventually you'll have fs privs and database privs anyway

    inject "request" and whitelist requirable modules?

bcrypt the passwords
passport integration for authentication
letsencrypt integration


---
UI

menu on caret at right of hookItem
    <span class="caret" style='float:right' onclick='showInfo("click"!);'>

factor out client-side hookBoss

editor: can't type in find input
    press control+F
    see find window
    can't click in it to type

clear editor on delete? (of last hook)

bug:
    click hook_1 and change the text
    click hook_2
    the change to hook_1 is lost without warning

bug(?): new hook (no hookId) on existing path/method pair
    new hook
    set path to an existing hook
    save
    should message or replace existing hook
    instead, creates unhittable route
    error message for this case?

accordion for hooks/editor?

Live update features

socket.io integration
    live hit counts on the edit screen via socket.io
    per-request log update -> client
        live hit counts in the hook window
        live log viewer

global log view for server
detailed log view per hook
    winston provides by-date
    winston is slow
    loki?

futures

database driven routing

add a way to add a middleware function to a route instead of a bound dispatch function

add better-fidelity inspection of app._routes

consider integrating for /public file manager:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudcmd

- test on
    heroku
    dokku
    deis

- way to instrument a catch-all route

-limited-duration hooks for demo mode
    self-destruct in x minutes

- editor theme selector

- versioned hooks

- way to disable hook but leave it defined

- libraries of hooks
    - ramkvs
    - loki?
    - mysql
    - mongo
    - redis
- save/restore hook sets
- share hook sets
