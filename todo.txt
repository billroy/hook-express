- auth on api and editor
- ssl

- better function sandbox (like node-red)

auth
    separate admin+api auth from hooks and static served files

    /hooks/**,
    /editor/**,
    /routeList

    the hooks
    static served files mounted under /

SSL support
    and make it easy

bug: hook exceptions return too much to client
    throw new Error('Baloney!');

get-all-hooks should return an array, not an object
    remove conversion-to-object in client

security
    require('fs') problem
    run like node-red functions
        controlled context
    eventually you'll have fs privs and database privs anyway

inject "request" and whitelist requirable modules

bug:
click hook_1 and change the text
click hook_2
the change to hook_1 is lost without warning

clear editor on delete? (of last hook)

delete all should empty the path control

method to lock/disable admin api until next restart

bug(?): new hook (no hookId) on existing path/method pair
    new hook
    set path to an existing hook
    save
    should message or replace existing hook
    instead, creates unhittable route
    error message for this case?
