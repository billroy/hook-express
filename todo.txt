log request IP
hide/blacklist req.headers.authorization
why isn't console log colorized?

API and internals

/hx/load load hook set from url

post /hooks should handle array of hooks
    TODO: move it to saveHook
    TODO: make a hook manager

method to lock/disable admin api until next restart
        POST /hx/lock {"confirm": "lock"}

enable easy embedding in other express apps (like cloudcmd)

optional additional user auth table for hooks and static-served files from /public
    /hx/users
    hook to add/delete/list user to apiUsers

get rid of server::hooks structure?
    - use routing tables directly
    how to identify hooks for replacement?
        name is working pretty well...

Security

bug: hook exceptions return too much to client
    throw new Error('Baloney!');

better function sandbox (like node-red)
    security
    require('fs') problem
    run like node-red functions
        controlled context
    eventually you'll have fs privs and database privs anyway

    inject "request" and whitelist requirable modules?

bcrypt the passwords
passport integration for authentication
letsencrypt integration

UI

editor: can't type in find input
    press control+F
    see find window
    can't click in it to type

clear editor on delete? (of last hook)

bug:
    click hook_1 and change the text
    click hook_2
    the change to hook_1 is lost without warning

bug(?): new hook (no hookId) on existing path/method pair
    new hook
    set path to an existing hook
    save
    should message or replace existing hook
    instead, creates unhittable route
    error message for this case?

accordion for hooks/editor?

---
Live update features

socket.io integration
    live hit counts on the edit screen via socket.io
    per-request log update -> client
        live hit counts in the hook window
        live log viewer

global log view for server
detailed log view per hook
    winston provides by-date
    winston is slow
    loki?

Hygiene

move the protected api to /hx/hooks?
    /hx/hooks
    /hx/logs
    /hx/lock
    /hx/users
    where the editor?  /hx/editor? /editor?

futures

add a way to add a middleware function to a route instead of a bound dispatch function

add better-fidelity inspection of app._routes

consider integrating for /public file manager:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudcmd

- test on
    heroku
    dokku
    deis

-limited-duration hooks for demo mode
    self-destruct in x minutes

- clone: var new = Object.assign({}, old);

- editor theme selector

- host indicator (location.origin)

- versioned hooks

- way to disable hook but leave it defined

- libraries of hooks
    - mysql
    - mongo
    - redis
- save/restore hook sets
- share hook sets
