TODO hook-express
-br

- auth on api and editor
- ssl

- better function sandbox (like node-red)

where delete all?
put delete-all on a dropdown button with delete selected hook
delete ALL HOOKS

auth
    separate admin+api auth from hooks and static served files

    /hooks/**,
    /editor/**,
    /routeList

    the hooks
    static served files mounted under /

SSL support
    and make it easy

get-all-hooks should return an array, not an object
    remove conversion-to-object in client

security
    require('fs') problem
    run like node-red functions
        controlled context
    eventually you'll have fs privs and database privs anyway

inject "request" and whitelist requirable modules

bug:
click hook_1 and change the text
click hook_2
the change to hook_1 is lost without warning

clear editor on delete?
    select what on delete?

delete all should empty the path control

after saving an item the cursor should end up on that item
    there should be less flash in the hook list

method to lock/disable admin api until next restart

bug: new hook (no hookId) on existing path/method pair
    new hook
    set path to an existing hook
    save
    should message or replace existing hook
    instead, creates unhittable route
